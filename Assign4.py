******************************
This file serves as the main program script for Assignment 4.
It loads airport and flight data from specified files into
Airport and Flight objects, storing them in global containers.
It defines functions to query this data (e.g., find flights by city/country,
find shortest flights, check connectivity, find return flights).
It also loads maintenance records from a file, calculating total costs
and durations, and sorting records. Imports Airport, Flight, and
MaintenanceRecord classes.
