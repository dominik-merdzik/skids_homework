This file defines the Flight class.
Each Flight object represents a flight route from an origin Airport
to a destination Airport, including a flight number and duration.
It includes methods for comparison, combining flights (__add__),
determining if a flight is domestic, string representation, and
accessing/modifying flight attributes. It imports the Airport class.
